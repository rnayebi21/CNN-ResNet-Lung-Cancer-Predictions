## CNN-ResNet-Lung-Cancer-Predictions
For my senior project, I created a convolution nueral network that 
takes in histopathological images of lung cell tissue and differentiates 
the tissue cells as being benign, having lung adenocarcinomas (lung_aca)
or having lung squamous cell carcinomas (lung_scc). The data I used is 
from the LC25000 Lung and colon histopathological image dataset which 
can be found at:

After downloading the dataset from the website I transffered the files into 
the following google drive file:

However, I wrote some code in order to split the data into a training and
testing set into a new file (see the file titled "Splitting into Training
and Testing.ipynb"). The separated data can be found at:

Note that the try file was an expirmental file that can be ignored.

Furthermore, the tutorials and structure of the code is from Akash N S and
it can be found here:
